# dark_template

A Flutter Application that is built to serve it's only purpose to serve as a template for `DARK THEME`.

## Inspiration:
[Pawan Kumar's DevFest Application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw272X66qvU&list=PLR2qQy0Zxs_Vju3tKnYgzbAhywHHPuDjQ)<br>
His source code is open sourced as well, go [here](https://github.com/iampawan/DevfestTutorialApp/tree/dev%23ch2) to send him some love.<br>

### Usage

* Clone the repository
* Hit `flutter run` in the terminal.
* In the top right corner press the `light bulb` to change the theme of the application.

<img src="assets/Light.png" height=500>

<img src="assets/Dark.png" height=500>

* All you need is a `bool` to do this, meh!
* Not just yet, go ahead and clean the cache, the app still gets rendered in its theme specified.

### Where do I code?

All you need to do is, write your own pages and keep it inside the `pages` folder.

The two sample pages are well commented. 

`ConfigBloc().darkModeOn ? <Do something in dark theme> : <Do something is light theme>`
